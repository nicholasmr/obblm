        <![CDATA[
        <b>Preliminary info</b><br>
        First of all you should know that OBBLM is capable of handling re-saves to the same match report - even after subsequent matches have been played by the same teams.
        Therefore if you, for example, typed in an incorrect &Delta; treasury value or some wrong player field value, you can correct the errors by simply changing the fields to the wanted values and re-saving.<br>
        Secondly, OBBLM supports the submission of a wide range of different player stats. 
        The commonly recorded player match stats are submitted via. the primary match report along with general match information whilst the <i>extra stats</i> are submitted on a separate submission page - follow the below extra stats link on the primary report page.
        Please note that you <i>must</i> submit the primary report before submitting the extra player stats.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Game information fields</b><br>
        The purpose of these fields is merely to store general match information. They have therefore <i>nothing</i> to do with team incomes or any other team related stats.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Sportsmanship points</b><br>
        Yelling, screaming, cursing at the dice, disturbing the opponent in his turn and not turning up on gaming night may be punished by giving negative sportsmanship points. Acting like a gentleman and taking a defeat with a smile may be embraced by giving positive sportsmanship points.
        If your league on the other hand makes the needle on the evil-o-meter jump into the red area constantly, it may be more natural applying the sportsmanship points system the other way around - embracing bad manners with positive sportsmanship points.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Casualties in general</b><br>
        OBBLM can keep track of <i>team casualties</i>, which is the sum of the individual player casualties, opponent self-inflicted injuries, die on a fumble in sprints and crowd killings (and possibly other things of your leagues' choice).
        Regarding <i>individual player</i> casualties OBBLM can also keep track of the different types of injuries inflicted (bh, si and ki), so please use this possibility instead of adding casualties made by a player as kills.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Player skills</b><br>
        When you roll 2D6 for player improvements remember to record the results in the <i>IR</i> fields. 
        Then, once the match report has been submitted, OBBLM will allow you to pick new player skills from the team pages - if enough SPPs have been gained.<br>
        If the improvement roll fields are <i>consistently</i> left as 0 the player in question may select among all skills whenever enough SPP is gained.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Player injuries</b><br>
        If a player sustains multiple injuries simply utilize the second and third injury columns "ageing 1" and "ageing 2". 
        The <i>only</i> difference between the ordinary "inj" column and the ageing columns is that injuries recorded as ageing injuries do not imply a MNG.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Incomes</b><br>
        A team's income must be calculate manually to represent the <i>full</i> change of the team's treasury over the game. OBBLM does not do income calculations for you.
        If you spended more than you made in a match then simply prefix - (minus).
        <br><br>
        Remember these factors when you calculate:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Spiraling expenses</li>
            <li>Treasury spend on inducements</li>
            <li>Hiring costs of star players and mercenaries</li>
            <li>Team winnings</li>
            <li>Tournament winnings, if the game was a final</li>

    <intro>Introduction</intro>

    <![CDATA[
    OBBLM is a Blood Bowl league manager that works by coaches submitting match data after each played match in a tournament. 
    League commissioners (admins) may create tournaments and include certain coaches' teams to participate in a tournament. 
    When a tournament is created, the two coaches participating in any match may submit a match report to the system. 
    The manager will thereby be able to update tournament stats and team details - including giving the team coach access to chose new player skills etc.
    The order in which tournament matches are played/submitted does not matter, and if the need may arise, league commissioners are able to delete unplayed matches.
    <br><br>
    <b>The Coach Corner:</b><br>
        When you have received a password from a league commissioner, and you have logged on, your personal coach corner will be activated in the menu bar. 
        At your coach corner you will be able to create new teams, and change your password, e-mail and your coach name.
        <br><br>
        <b>Team page</b><br>
        At your team page you may manage your team. 
        This includes buying and selling players, choosing player skills when your player has the required amount of SPP, and buying other goods for your team.
        <br>
        At your team page you will be presented with your team roster. To view player details select the "toggle roster view"-link below the roster.
        <br><br>
    <b>Submitting a played match:</b><br>
        Once a match has been played, you must let the system know by submitting the match data in the <i>tournaments</i> section. 
        This can under agreement be done by either team's coach. Only the two participating team coaches and league commissioners have edit access to the match reports.

    <faq_txt>
    <![CDATA[
    <i>Q:</i>
    I can't seem to save a player's injury when submitting match data.<br>
    <i>A:</i>
    OBBLM will refuse to save a specific injury if the sum of the characteristic thereby will drop below the allowed default - 2 limit.
    <br><br>
    
    <i>Q:</i>
    I'm not able to select the achieved characteristic I wish?<br>
    <i>A:</i>
    You are by rule not allowed to select any further achieved characteristics if it leads to the player having more than default + 2 of that characteristic.
    <br><br>

    <i>Q:</i>
    I have saved a match with wrong match data, and now OBBLM has created a new match with the wrong contestants. How do I correct this?<br>
    <i>A:</i>
    First you delete the falsely created match, and then you resave the old match with the correct match data, which recreates the new match.
    <br><br>
    
    <i>Q:</i>
    I can't seem to save -1 fan factor when submitting match data?<br>
    <i>A:</i>
    OBBLM will refuse to save any further negative fan factor values if your team already has 0 fan factor.
    <br><br>
    
    <i>Q:</i>
    Re-roll prices are no longer doubled?<br>
    <i>A:</i>
    Have you switched on the setting "static re-rolls prices"? 
    If not, what you experience is due to your league having started on a new tournament, in which no matches yet have been played. The RR-prices will become doubled again once the first match has been played.
    <br><br>
    
    <i>Q:</i>
    I have suddenly a dead player alive again on my roster?<br>
    <i>A:</i>
    Re-save the match in which the player died.
    <br><br>
                    
    <i>Q:</i>
    I see only fields on the match submitting pages for the inducements stars and mercenaries, where are the others?<br>
    <i>A:</i>
    Such fields do not exist yet. If you wish to document these match details, you can write them in the match summary.
    <br><br>
    
    <i>Q:</i>
    I'm having trouble uploading pictures. How can i resolves this?<br>
    <i>A:</i>
    OBBLM supports only .gif, .jpg, .jpeg and .png file types. Still having trouble? Try a mozilla browser.
    <br><br>

    <i>Q:</i>
    After hiring a journeyman he stays on my roster even though he has already competed in a match. Why is this so?<br>
    <i>A:</i>
    OBBLM does not automatically fire journeymen after their first match. You must do so yourself the same way as ordinary players are fired (via. the team page).
    <br><br>

    <i>Q:</i>
    I would like to create my own tournament ranking system. How do I do this?<br>
    <i>A:</i>
    Please see the <i>settings.php</i> file.
    <br><br>

    <i>Q:</i>
    How do I heal all of a team's MNGs?<br>
    <i>A:</i>
    Simply open the match report from the team's latest played match, and reassign the injuries sustained as ageing injuries - these do not result in MNGs.

        <![CDATA[
            <b>When scheduling matches please note that:</b><br>
            - You must first create a league with one or more divisions before being able to create tournaments (in which matches are scheduled).<br>
            - You are free to schedule multiple tournaments running concurrently.<br>
            - You are NOT restricted to playing matches in their scheduled order. In fact, any team may play any scheduled match at any time.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Round-Robin (RR) scheduling</b>:<br>
                In a RR tournament each contestant meets every other contestant in turn.<br>
                The entire set of matches in which all contestants meet each other <i>once</i> is called a <i>bracket</i>.<br>
                A bracket consists of multiple rounds in which each team plays <i>only one match</i>.<br>
                A bracket may be seeded more than once in a RR tournament.<br>
                When seeding the bracket multiple times the home&mdash;away pairings are swapped every second time.<br>
                If an uneven number of teams is selected each team will, in each seeded bracket, receive <i>one</i> bye (walkthrough) in a given round.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Free For All (FFA) scheduling</b>:<br>
                The FFA tournament type allows scheduling matches on-demand.<br>
                You may either add the scheduled matches to a new tournament or add them to an existing FFA tournament.<br>
                If only two teams are selected the match is scheduled by setting the first selected team as the home team.<br>
                If multiple teams are selected the list of teams is shuffled, creating random matches with random home&mdash;away pairings.<br>
                Only an even number of teams may be selected.<br>
                The FFA tournament type may also be used to create Knock-Out tournaments and other tournament types by manually scheduling matches.<br>
