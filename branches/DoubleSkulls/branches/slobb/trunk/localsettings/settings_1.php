$settings['rules']         = '<div class="commonhead">League Officials</div>
<BR />
<BR />Commissioner: Rabid Bogscum
<BR />Admins: Virral & Doubleskulls (webmaster)
<BR />Welcome to SLOBB, a Sydney based Blood Bowl league for avid coaches with plenty of real life on their plate, but a passion for Blood Bowl, and a passion to be part of an ongoing league with flexibility to play once a month or as much as you can arrange.
<BR />
<BR />The key structure to the league is its two tiered approach. A fixed league with 1 team per coach, and a commitment to play 1 game a month over 6-8 months each season (including finals). With a take home trophy for the winner, and plans for an extravagant perpetual trophy in a few seasons time, dependant on coaching enthusiasm. This league is setup for those people that want to be part of a Blood Bowl league but struggle to find enough regular free time to commit to a more time intensive competition.
<BR />
<BR />For the Dungeon Bowl 2009 season the league is divided into four conferences of 5 teams. The conferences are paired together (Lazy Lumps East and West, Bone Idlers East and West). Every team plays everyone in their own conference once and one randomly selected team in the paired conference. The top two from each conference qualify for the quarter finals with the top team in each conference playing the second placed team in the paired conference. The semi finals will be between the winners of the pairs (so an all Lazy Lumps semi, and an all Bone Idlers semi).
<BR />
<BR />The second tier is an open league more in line with the fluff of Blood Bowl, travelling teams who arrange games on the run, and split the gate receipts. It is for those that need more than 1 game a month to get their Blood Bowl fix, or for those that are so damn busy they can&acute;t even commit to one game a month. Coaches can have as many teams as they want, with the only rules regarding who you can play being that the same two teams can&acute;t play each other 3 times in a row. There will be a KO tournament when the fixed league is in its finals, where coaches nominate their favourite team, and attempt to win some glory, but entering is not mandatory. It is a Sydney based league (not greater Sydney), so while anyone is welcome, the onus is on you to travel to play your games if you live further out.
<BR />
<BR /><div class="commonhead">Rules</div>
<BR />SLOBB will be running the BBRC 2008 experimental rules (available at http://www.blood-bowl.net/LRB_PBBL/LRB_5_plus_Experimental2008.pdf), this is the current experimental rule set and will largely be the official rules at the end of 2009. We also use the Slann, Underworld and Chaos Pact teams. Included are the optional rules on special play cards.
<BR />There is no overtime except in finals where the following will apply: SLOBB O/T - players roll to decide who will kick off, and then play a standard half of Blood Bowl (rerolls carrying over from the second half but not replenished) no golden scoring rule applies, all 8 turns per coach are to be played. If the scores a still tied each coach rolls a D6, with the coach with the most casualties adding +1, the highest score is the team that progresses. Any rules clarifications can be answered by the commish or admin team.
<BR /><div class="commonhead">Bonus Special Play Cards</div>
<BR />Coaches have the option in both the open league and the fixed league to receive 100,000 gold pieces to spend on their choice of special play cards. This is completely optional and must be agreed to by each coach prior to starting the game, if one coach doesn&acute;t agree, then there is no bonus allocation of special play cards. This convoluted setup is designed to add flexibility to the league, allowing those players who loved the old special play cards and like to see some randomness in their games of Blood Bowl to do so, while also catering to players that are after a more current Australian tournament setup, and who don&acute;t like absolute randomness effecting the result of their games. I encourage any and all feedback on this rule throughout the season, as with most things it will be reviewed as to its success. Possible changes could see; the allocation being non optional, allocation being scrapped, different agreed upon gold pieces allocations to name a few.
<BR /><div class="commonhead">Open League</div>
<BR />Coaches are allowed to have as many teams as they want in the open league. To create a new team simply contact one of the admins and a blank team will be created for you. Match reporting is to be entered by either coach, and teams are fully editable. It is asked that coaches monitor their opponent&acute;s teams and advise the commissioner if there are any anomalies with team development so they can be investigated. There will be consequences for coaches caught cheating which may result in the offending person being thrown out of the league.
<BR />There is an end of season KO tournament where each coach can nominate one of their teams to take part, for uneven numbers of teams, TV will determine which teams receive byes and coaches will generally have 2 months to have their games for the KO completed, the commissioner reserves the right to alter this time period and/or cap the number of teams. SLOBB O/T applies for any games.
<BR /><div class="commonhead">Fixed League</div>
<BR />The fixed league is the primary focus of the league. The first season we will be playing for the Dungeon Bowl Trophy, including the stated fringe benefits. There will be a take home trophy as well as a professionally painted Wizard Miniature for the winner of the Dungeon Bowl to use as their Wizard Inducement - painted in the colours of their appropriate college of magic.
<BR />For the Dungeon Bowl 2009 season the league is divided into four conferences of 5 teams. The conferences are paired together (Lazy Lumps East and West, Bone Idlers East and West). Every team plays everyone in their own conference once and one randomly selected team in the paired conference. The top two from each conference qualify for the quarter finals with the top team in each conference playing the second placed team in the paired conference. The semi finals will be between the winners of the pairs (so an all Lazy Lumps semi, and an all Bone Idlers semi).
<BR />
<BR />Scoring is as follows:
<BR />Win = 3 points
<BR />Draw = 1 Point
<BR />Loss = 0 Points
<BR />Forfeit = -1 Point
<BR />
<BR />The website will work out positions for teams on equal points based on net TDs followed by net Cas. Please note however that head to head result will always override such placings, and as such the commissioner&acute;s interpretation of multiple head to head results will take precedence.
<BR />
<BR />Deadlines for each round are the end of each calendar month. I have also reluctantly agreed to be tough on players that don&acute;t get their games played; there will be no extensions under any circumstances. If one coach can prove to me they made every effort to get the game played and it was down to their opponent that they didn&acute;t hit the field, then they will be awarded the forfeit. (please note, there will be no mvps/winnings rolls etc to make up for the lost match as I feel LRB 5.0 suitably takes care of any TV discrepancies). The forfeiting coach will receive a -1 point penalty. That said I understand things come up. If a coach simply can`t play their round that month, and there&acute;s nothing they can do about it, if they come forward about it (the earlier the better), they will not be slugged with the penalty. Neither coach being able to prove to me they have made an effort will see both coaches receive penalties. Two of either type of forfeit in a season will result in expulsion from the league, and great difficulty getting back in.
<BR />
<BR />Teams in the fixed league are not editable after playing their first game. Please ensure player names are completed to your satisfaction before lodging that first match report. The commissioner will update all teams throughout the season, players are welcome to upload the match report themselves or leave it to me, but I would like to see individual comments from the coaches for each match in the fixed league.
<BR />
<BR />Match reports must be entered into the site and approved by both the opponent and comissioner prior to your teams being updated. To do this use the Report Result link on the left hand side and enter all the details of the match.
<BR />
<BR /><div class="commonhead">League Fees</div>
<BR />As stated there will be a take home trophy for the winner of the fixed league. Therefore, unfortunately I need to impose a league fee of $5.
<BR /><div class="commonhead">Slobb Rule Interpretations</div>
<BR />
<BR />These will be updated from season to season as coaches raise queries about rules.
<BR />Illegal Procedure: As with the current tournament scene, Illegal Procedure will only apply if both coaches agree to it. That said if you are someone who struggles to move their turn counter, I recommend you play with this rule until the cold hard reality of having your game stuffed up time and again sinks in, and moving your turn counter becomes a subconscious thing for you.
<BR />Team Casualties: Team casualties only include casualties that result in spps for a player. i.e. from blocks. Fouls, crowd pushes, thrown rocks, weapon related injuries, failed dodges, gfi&acute;s etc do not apply.';
